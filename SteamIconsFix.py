# No need for API key, or SteamID, or SteamDB
# It will auto download SteamCMD and place it in the Steam folder, if you don't have it already from
# https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Downloading_SteamCMD

# This script will download the icons for all installed games in your Steam library
# It will also download the icons for all games you specify as arguments
# If any icons fail to download, it will print a list of the failed icons at the end
# You can then run the script again with the list of failed app IDs as arguments to retry downloading the icons for the failed games

# Usage:
# python SteamIconsFix.py [<app_id> ...] <list> <all>

# Example: python SteamIconsFix.py 730 440 570 228980
