# Steam Icons Fix

(Windows only, might be helpful for doing other things though)

This Python script is used to download icons for all the installed games in your Steam library. The script also allows
downloading icons for specific games by specifying their app IDs as command-line arguments. If any icons fail to
download, the script will print a list of the failed icons at the end. You can then run the script again with the list
of failed app IDs as arguments to retry downloading the icons for the failed games.

My Steam Icons were blank on my desktop after a fresh windows 10 / windows 11 re-install. The icons were missing and it
was painful to have to download them one by one so I made this script to do it for me.

I hope it helps you too.

(After running the script, you might need to refresh your desktop/restart PC or clear icon cache to see the icons, it
worked for me after a refresh)

Note: This script is not affiliated with Steam or Valve Corporation in any way. It is an independent project created by
me to help Steam users download icons for their games.
Make sure you have a fresh python environment with the required packages installed. (See below)
A fresh python environment is recommended to avoid any conflicts with other packages you may have installed.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)

The below are required Python packages. You can install them by running the following commands in terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/#install)
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm#installation)
- [Python Steam](https://github.com/ValvePython/steam)

If python steam fails then SteamCMD is downloaded and installed by the script if it is not already installed:

- [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Downloading_SteamCMD)

## Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the repository directory in the terminal. Run this command to install the
necessary Python packages:

## Usage

Run the script with the following commands in terminal:

1. To download icons for specific games, provide the app IDs:
   ```bash
   python SteamIconsFix.py 730 440 570 228980
   ```

2. To print the list of installed games, run:
   ```bash
   python SteamIconsFix.py list
   ```

3. To download icons for all installed games, run:
   ```bash
   python SteamIconsFix.py all
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If any icons fail to download, the script will print a list of failed icons at the end. To retry downloading the icons
for these games, use the following command (replace `<failed_app_ids>` with the space-separated list of failed app IDs):

```bash
   python SteamIconsFix.py <failed_app_ids>
   ```

If there's an exception on first run a after a long pause, re-running the script usually succeeds on the 2nd or 3rd time.
